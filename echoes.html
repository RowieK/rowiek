            <p>During sprint 1, I aim to investigate which hardware and software are required to create a working MVP for Society 5.0, so that the involved stakeholders gain insight into the unethical aspects of eavesdropping equipment. 
                The goal is to raise awareness of how easy it is to be monitored without being noticed.
                During sprint 1, I focused on developing hardware and writing code for a specific piece of hardware, in this case the ESP32-CAM module. For this, I used the Arduino IDE, which allowed me to write and upload software to the device.
                To actually obtain the video feed, I built a dashboard myself with an integrated network scanner that retrieves the IP and MAC addresses of the device, as well as those of other devices on the network.
                I did this to make the system easy to use for users. I acquired this knowledge by reading the documentation of the module and the Arduino IDE, and by watching YouTube videos to see how others approached this.

            <p>
                During sprint 2, I wanted to further develop my knowledge of hardware and networking.
                To achieve this, I completed several courses and obtained certifications.
                This knowledge helped me better understand how the project works, as I am directly
                dealing with hardware and networks. In addition to the courses I completed,
                I also focused more on security and privacy.
            </p>

            <p>
                For example, the camera streams over a network, meaning that anyone on the same
                network can view the live camera feed. Based on this knowledge, I implemented
                a stream pool. I learned this through the courses, as it was not possible to
                display multiple streams on a single dashboard because that would require
                multiple processes, which does not work.
            </p>

            <p>
                Once an IP address is added to the stream pool, the camera stream can no longer
                be accessed directly via the camera’s IP address. As a result, the live feed
                can only be viewed on the device that registered the IP address in the stream pool.

            <p>
                During sprint 3, I want to fully focus on developing the front-end and back-end
                of my project. After gaining more insight into networking and hardware in the
                previous sprint, it is now time to translate this technical foundation into software.
            </p>

            <p>
                To further shape my “Dark Tech” studio, I will learn how to design a modern interface
                and how to build a stable back-end that supports my application. My goal is to
                establish an initial working connection between both components, providing the
                project with a solid software foundation.
            </p>

            <h3>Step 1 – Creating a “Dark” and “Light” version</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Develop two front-end themes: one dark-themed and one light-themed.</li>
                <li>Refine the “Dark” theme based on the Figma designs.</li>
                <li>Design a consistent user interface for both variants.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Step 2 – Connecting LED lighting to the dashboard</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Build back-end functionality to control LED lighting.</li>
                <li>Add front-end controls (on/off, color, intensity).</li>
                <li>Test communication between the dashboard and the hardware.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Step 3 – Testing and improving based on user experience</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Conduct testing sessions with users.</li>
                <li>Collect feedback on usability, clarity, and themes.</li>
                <li>Implement improvements in design and functionality.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Contributing to the Advisory Report</h3>
            <p>
                In addition to developing the front-end and back-end, I will also contribute
                to creating an advisory report during this sprint. This report supports the
                project by providing insight into design choices, solution directions, and
                key considerations.
            </p>

            <p>
                My role is to think along, gather information, and present it clearly and in a
                structured manner. I will mainly focus on analyzing the current situation at
                both the software and hardware level, researching possible solutions, and
                clearly formulating recommendations.

            </div>
            <p class="semester-meta">Focus: documentation, retrospectives, next steps.</p>
                <p>
                    During sprint 3, I wanted to fully focus on the development of the front-end and
                    back-end of my project. Because I gained more insight into networking and hardware
                    during sprint 2, it was time to translate this technical foundation into software –
                    which I successfully did. During this sprint, I implemented both the “Dark” and
                    “Light” dashboards, along with the facial recognition algorithm.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In addition to implementing the Figma designs into the application, I improved
                    the video streams by adding better error handling. This makes it clearer what
                    goes wrong when the camera is not running, for example errors such as
                    “TCP gateway error”.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Because ethics are central to the “Light” dashboard, facial recognition was
                    deliberately not implemented in this version. Instead, a feature was added
                    that allows all JavaScript scripts to be disabled using a single button on
                    the right side of the dashboard. This ensures that users can no longer interact
                    with the dashboard until the page is refreshed.
                </p>

                <p>
                    On the “Dark” dashboard, users are able to take screenshots of the video stream
                    and process them using an algorithm that detects faces and trousers on an
                    individual. These images are stored within the project itself, allowing users
                    to select which images they want to view and from which date directly within
                    the dashboard.
                </p>

                <h3>Contributing to the Advisory Report</h3>
                <p>
                    In addition to creating the prototype, I also contributed to the advisory report.
                    In this role, I provided advice on specific topics, adjusted information where
                    necessary, improved spelling, and added missing content – fulfilling a consulting
                    role.
                </p>

                <p>
                    While doing so, I also took analyses into account, including stakeholder analysis
                    and the implementation of Society 5.0 user test results within the advisory report.
                </p>

                <h3>Future Plans</h3>
                <p>
                    In the future (after this project), I plan to further deepen my knowledge of ethics
                    within ICT. Although my interest strongly lies in ethics, it is also a highly
                    important topic in which I currently have limited knowledge.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I aim to develop this knowledge through reliable and specialized information
                    sources focused on ethics, such as:
